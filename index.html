                <h2>Founder of Tanzeem-e-Islami</h2>
            <p><b>Israr Ahmad</b> was born on 26 April 1932 in Agarwal family in Hisar, Punjab.[8] His father was a civil servant in the British governmentwho relocated his family from Hisar to Montgomery, now Sahiwal, Punjab Province of Pakistan.
                Ahmad worked briefly for Muslim Student's Federation in the Independence Movement and, following the creation of Pakistan in 1947, for the Islami Jami`yat-e-Talaba and then in 1950 joined Jamaat-e-Islami led by Abul Ala Maududi, but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmad resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in national politics, which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period. His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to Karachi, Sindh Province in the 1960s. where he enrolled in Karachi University.
                Dr Israr Ahmad {MBBS} .He was the founder of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an offshoot of the Jamaat-e-Islami.[6][3] He wrote about sixty books about Islam and Pakistan. As of 2017, twenty nine books have been translated into several other languages, including in English.[7]
